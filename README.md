# Secure Private AI Scholarship
This repository contains python scripts for Machine Learning, learned during my time participating in the <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/facebook-AI-scholarship"><b>Secure and Private AI Facebook Scholarship Challenge</b></a> by Udacity.<br>
In the repository are the basics of deep learning with PyTorch and some of my completed projects.<br>
All of these are my personal notes and exercises for learning, made accessible to my classmates in case they needed help for a solution.

## Motivation
This project exists so I can track my progress on the course, showcase what I've been learning, and also save my work as a reference in the future, in case I need a refresher on anything I had learned.
